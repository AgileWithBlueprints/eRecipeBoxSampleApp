Ingredients:
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails attached
Kosher salt
2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes, more to your liking
Extra virgin olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
5 garlic cloves, minced
1 cup dry white wine
1 (15-ounce can) diced fire-roasted tomatoes, or plain fire-roasted tomatoes
¼ cup tomato paste-high un
Black pepper
2 teaspoons dried oregano
½ cup chopped fresh parsley

Instructions:
Pat the shrimp dry and season with kosher salt and 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.
Heat 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet. Add the shrimp and cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute over medium heat. Transfer the shrimp and its juices to a plate for now. (If the shrimp is still grey in some parts it is okay, it will finish cooking in the sauce).
In the same skillet, heat another 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil over medium-high until shimmering. Reduce the heat to medium then add the onions and garlic. Cook for 5 minutes over medium heat, tossing regularly, until the onions have softened and turned a light golden brown (manage your heat to make sure the garlic does not burn). Add the white wine and cook until reduced by half.
Stir in the diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Season with kosher salt, black pepper, the oregano, and the remaining red pepper flakes. Bring to boil, then lower the heat to medium low and allow the sauce to simmer for 10 minutes or so until thickened.
Return the shrimp to the skillet and nestle it into the sauce. Cook for 1 more minute or until the shrimp is just warmed through and pink. Finish with fresh parsley. Serve immediately with your favorite crusty bread, pasta, or rice.


Notes:
Make ahead tips: You can make the tomato sauce a day or two in advance and save it in the fridge in a tight-lid container. When you're ready, warm up the sauce and cook the shrimp according to the recipe.  
For a more spicy fra diavolo: If you need more heat to your fra diavolo sauce, you can add more red pepper flakes or chop up some fresh hot peppers and add them in the sauce (you can just throw them in to sauté with the onions and garlic).
Leftovers and storage: Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days. Remove the shrimp from the sauce before heating it up, then tuck the shrimp in just before eating.
