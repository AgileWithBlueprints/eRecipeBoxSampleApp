# eRecipeBox Sample App

This repo complements the eBook _How I Built a Business App using Agile w/ Blueprints,_ [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Built-Business-using-Agile-Blueprints-ebook/dp/B0D99237RB/ref=sr_1_10?crid=8F9NSEQZAPIM&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kLLgXG8VJkJ7zpQlBz9g_fbMEDLTQ0fpIULS3iPGb0YFBSMXWYkXdPsUkMq1P62VQNxBPwiVxvy_5QSaOT9jzlCUCsLS__4qOwTEE9NRIalTE2rUOKUSi5On51vllymuwNF0Zjq9TLySKrPUAn0EPB2s0unrHy12rV8XOoc_noJB_PRWKn1bBn417fkZgjLKnpJ5oxJTUsqRk-T4rh7ioWGfeF6vMnF6UazOSEeJi98.LBkwL8892pzeDeO7gxSOwSIXLj8oamV2H9_CVzn1O1k) for $9.99. “Agile w/ Blueprints” (AwB) is a lightweight yet comprehensive process for building production-quality business applications. Evolved and refined over 20 years by a pragmatic practitioner, it applies proven best practices for small—to medium-sized teams to quickly and efficiently develop software solutions that solve business problems.

The book introduces AwB through a complete, instructional, working example - this eRecipeBox app. [This video](https://www.agilewithblueprints.com/home/#ViewSampleAppVideo)<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Open Example in a New Tab</a> illustrates the app in action. Together, they form the AwB Quick Start. The eBook educates the reader on AwB’s core engineering practices, introduces AwB’s framework, then narrates how the team built eRecipeBox MVP 1.0 over the span of five, one-week sprints. Readers study the sample app while working through the eBook.

_Individuals_ build their skills by enhancing eRecipeBox. Additionally, entire Agile w/ Blueprints _teams_ can grow their expertise by collaborating on ~50 suggested enhancements to the sample app. Assign members to their AwB role(s) and, together, enhance eRecipeBox over a couple of sprints. In addition to developing individual Agile w/ Blueprints skills, the team as a whole develops its AwB proficiency by establishing a productive culture & communication style of their own.

Agile w/ Blueprints is unique because it's comprehensive, covering all aspects required to develop a business application:

- Business Domain Model
- Product Vision, including ROI & Product Roadmap
- Business Processes & Workflow
- UI Design
- Detailed Requirements
- System Design
- User Education Strategy & Design
- System Test Strategy & Design
- Automated Testing
- Team Structure, Roles & Responsibilities
- Agile Sprint Process
- Project Leadership
- Project Environments (Dev, Test, UE & Production)

This eRecipeBox sample app illustrates how all artifacts integrate and influence each other to develop a business solution efficiently and demonstrates solutions to common challenges when building business apps, such as:

- How to create a risk-driven sprint plan
- How domain & object driven development drive design and implementation
- How to design a reusable UI framework that supports CRUDing business data and UI window navigation
- How to design and implement automated system tests
- How to minimize effort documenting requirements by extracting detailed requirements from source code
- How to use automation to generate large test data sets for stress testing

# Audience

Because the process is comprehensive, the eBook’s target audience is all roles of a project team:

- Executive Sponsors
- Business Users
- Team Leads
- Analysts
- UI Designers
- Architects
- Developers
- Test Architects
- Test Developers
- User Education Architects
- User Education Developers

Team members understand their role and how their project decisions impact other areas of development.

# How to Use this Agile w/ Blueprints Quick Start

1. [Read the eBook](https://www.amazon.com/Built-Business-using-Agile-Blueprints-ebook/dp/B0D99237RB/ref=sr_1_10?crid=8F9NSEQZAPIM&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kLLgXG8VJkJ7zpQlBz9g_fbMEDLTQ0fpIULS3iPGb0YFBSMXWYkXdPsUkMq1P62VQNxBPwiVxvy_5QSaOT9jzlCUCsLS__4qOwTEE9NRIalTE2rUOKUSi5On51vllymuwNF0Zjq9TLySKrPUAn0EPB2s0unrHy12rV8XOoc_noJB_PRWKn1bBn417fkZgjLKnpJ5oxJTUsqRk-T4rh7ioWGfeF6vMnF6UazOSEeJi98.LBkwL8892pzeDeO7gxSOwSIXLj8oamV2H9_CVzn1O1k), which covers AwB as it presents the eRecipeBox working sample app and narrates how it was developed. Architects and developers, including Test, install the [eRecipeBox Source Package](https://www.agilewithblueprints.com/erecipebox-downloads) and study, build, and run their respective code. The remaining team roles install the [RecipeBox App-Single User](https://www.agilewithblueprints.com/erecipebox-downloads) so they can test drive it while reviewing the eBook.
2. Select a few enhancements and implement them in their eRecipeBox sandbox dev and test environment(s). Update all impacted artifacts - Business Model through Implementation, Test Strategy through Test Cases, and User Education Strategy through UE Implementation.
3. When comfortable with AwB engineering practices and skills, use the eRecipeBox artifacts as templates for your business app development project.
